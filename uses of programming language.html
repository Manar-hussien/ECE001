	  <h2> <br />  <u>	Importance and uses of programming language:   </u> <br /> </h2>
		
		<br />Programmers use communicate with computers using programming languages.
		There several languages exist, and each one has its own uniquecharacteristics, although they do share some similarities. 
		<br />    <br /> Because each language is different, each one within certain industries may be best suited for a particular purpose or purpose. 
		Many programming languages are used to construct programs for problem-solving or data analysis.<br />   <br /> 
		Other programming languages are more likely to create fun applications or games. 
		Requiring special and diverse programming languages, 
<br />  <br />  The creation of a single universal programming language that meets all the needs is virtually impossible.
		  The programming languages are frequently updated and even merged over time with other languages to suit our changing technical needs.<br />
	<h3>There are many uses of a programming language:</h3>
	
	<br />- The computer can be told what to do in a human-readable manner. <br />
	<br />-Lets the programmer structure the instructions in functions, procedures, etc.<br />
