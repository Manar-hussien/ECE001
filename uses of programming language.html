	  <h2> <br />  <u>	Importance and uses of :  programming language   </u> <br /> </h2>
		
		<br />Programmers use programming languages to communicate with computers. Many different languages exist, and each one has its own unique features, though they all share some similarities.<br />    <br /> Because each language is different, each may be best suited for a certain purpose or purposes within certain industries. Some programming languages are used to create programs to solve problems or interpret data.<br />   <br /> Other programming languages are more suitable for making create software or apps that entertain. With a strong need for unique and diverse programming languages,<br />  <br />  it is virtually impossible to create a single universal programming language that meets all needs. Programming languages are often revised and even combined with other languages over time, evolving to meet our changing technological needs.<br />
	<h3>A programming language serves several purposes:</h3>
	
	<br />- You can instruct the computer what to do in a human-readable form<br />
	<br />-Allows the programmer to structure the instructions into functions, procedures, etc<br />
