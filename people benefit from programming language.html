	  <h2> <br />  <u> The benefits of learning to code . 

  </u> <br /> </h2>
		Here are a few of the ways learning to code can benefit you.
     <h3>   1- Coding and programming careers have great earning potential    </h3>
	 
	 
	 - 
One of the strongest and most obvious draws of learning to code is the earning potential for coding and programming professionals. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) tracks salary and other important workforce information for a variety of careers.

	 
	 
	 <h3>  2-Demand remains strong for coding-related jobs </h3>
- What good is a strong salary if no one is looking to hire for the position? When it comes to coding-related jobs, there’s still plenty of opportunity.

	 
	 	 <h3>  3-Coding ability gives new perspective to problem solving</h3>
- “Learning to code has the inadvertent effect of teaching you how to think,” says Adrian Degus, CEO of Nuvro. He goes on to explain that he used to be more prone to solving problems emotionally. But his coding experience has taught him to approach problems logically. “Understanding logic, at a deep level, has improved my problem solving proficiency tenfold,” he adds.


<h3> 4- Learning to code offers career flexibility </h3>
	 
-Learning to code can help open up new areas of opportunity in your career and ultimately make you a more flexible candidate in a rapidly-shifting digital economy. Daniel Davidson, owner of Dan Design Co., started his career in print design but noticed he was consistently missing out on opportunities due to a lack of coding knowledge.


 	 <h3>   Coding can be useful in jobs you might not expect      </h3>
	 -
	 You might think coding and programming skills are only valuable for people working in highly technical specialist jobs. While it’s true that learning to code is more important for some roles, that doesn’t mean you can’t find practical ways to apply coding knowledge in non-coding jobs.
