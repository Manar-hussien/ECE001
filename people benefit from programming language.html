	  <h2> <br />  <u> The benefits of learning to code . 

  </u> <br /> </h2>
		Here are a few of the ways learning to code can benefit you.
     <h3>   1- Coding and programming careers have great earning potential    </h3>
	 
	 
	 - 
The earning potential for coding and programming professionals is one of the strongest and most obvious draws of learning to code.
 The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) tracks salary and other important information about the workforce for a range of careers. 

	 
	 
	 <h3>  2-Demand remains strong for coding-related jobs </h3>
-What good is a high salary if nobody wants to recruit for the position? There's always a lot of demand when it comes to coding-related work.

	 
	 	 <h3>  3-Coding ability gives new perspective to problem solving</h3>
- "Learning to code has the unintentional effect of teaching you how to think," says Nuvro CEO Adrian Degus.
 He goes on to explain he used to be more inclined to emotionally solve problems. Yet his familiarity with coding has helped him to objectively solve problems. 
"Deep-seated understanding of logic has strengthened my problem solving ability tenfold," he says.


<h3> 4- Learning to code offers career flexibility </h3>
	 
-Learning to code can help open up new areas of opportunities in your career and ultimately make you a more flexible candidate in a fast-moving digital economy.
 Daniel Davidson, owner of Dan Design Co., started his career in print design but found that due to a lack of coding expertise he was continually losing out on opportunities.


 	 <h3>   Coding can be useful in jobs you might not expect      </h3>
	 -
	 You might think that coding and programming skills are valuable only to people who work in highly technical specialist jobs. 
	 While it’s true that learning to code is more important for certain roles, it doesn’t mean that you can’t find practical ways to apply coding knowledge in non-coding jobs.
