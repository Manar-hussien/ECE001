	  	  <h3> type 1: Low level language: </h3> 

	 <br />	a-  Machine language (1GL).<br />
	<br />	b-  Assembly language (2GL).<br />
		<h3>  type 2: High level language: </h3> 
		<br />a-  Procedural-Oriented language (3GL)
.<br />
		<br />b- Problem-Oriented language (4GL) .<br />
	 <br />	3-Natural language (5GL).<br />
	
	 <h4> 1.       Low level language:</h4> 
This language is the most comprehensible language used by computer to run its operations.
		
		<h4>    2.       High level language: </h4> 
		
Instructions of this language  are closely resembling words like person or English. The task is performed using mathematical notations. 
It's easier to understand the language at the high point. It takes less time to write, so avoiding the errors easier.
 Either of the two separate language translator programs translates the high level language into a computer language; interpreter or compiler.
