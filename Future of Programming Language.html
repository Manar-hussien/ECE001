	<h2>The Future of Programming Languages</h2>

Advancing technology promises a continued evolution of programming languages. Predicting programming 's future, though, can be challenging.
As more appliances and devices are designed to run on a computer chip, software will need to be maintained regularly to keep it up to date and functioning correctly.
Programmers are constantly confronted with the challenges of protecting devices from viruses and developing applications that enaple users to use their devices cohesively.
The newest programming languages are going to be quicker and more intuitive with fewer errors and problems. 
 For instance, R is one of the most recent programming languages and was designed by statisticians for data analysis.
