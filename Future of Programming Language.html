	<h2>The Future of Programming Languages</h2>

Advancing technology promises that programming languages will continue to evolve. However, predicting the future of programming can be challenging.
As more appliances and devices are designed to operate with a computer chip, software will need to be maintained regularly to keep it up to date and functioning correctly.
Programmers continually face the challenges of protecting devices from viruses and developing applications that allow users to use their devices cohesively.
The newest programming languages will be faster and more intuitive with fewer errors and issues. For example, R is one of the most recent programming languages and was designed by statisticians for data analysis.
